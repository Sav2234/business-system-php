# business-system-php

This is my preliminary set up for a php based website for a business. As of January 31, 2022, all logout and login fucntions have been successfully set up.

# Future plans as of 01/31/2022:

-Set up css for the site
-Add more profile personalization
-Ablity to change password/username
-Add function to send an email when an account has been created, password changed, or when the account has been deleted

This will be open source for the time being for free use but as development proceeds, this is subjet to change

# Fixes, Additions, and Changes

## 01/31/2022: 

All login, logout, and user data have been added. Users can create an account and login.
